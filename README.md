# Airbus-ship-detection

## model progress
For now, we have developed an simple cnn model to detect whether there is a ship in the image or not. The accuracy is about 0.9. Considering the fact that users could upload lots of images in the same time and no ships on about 70% of the images, a simple model can speed up the whole process.


## web progress
Also, we have finished the framework of the web. The next step is to deploy the web to AWS.

## Next step
### 1、optimize the cnn model and overcome overfitting
### 2、develop the U-net model and predict the ship location
### 3、deploy the simple model and web to the AWS
